# APPLYING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR ANDROID MALWARE DETECTION
This final qualifying work presents an approach to Android malware detection based on deep learning. The paper discusses the problems of the existing approaches to analyzing the Android application using deep training, based on which we propose our own approach using a convolutional neural network. The paper reviews the drawbacks of the existing approaches to applications analysis using deep learning, based on which new approach is proposed using a convolutional neural network. The results of an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach demonstrates a high probability Android malware applications detection.
